## Javascript Core - From the beginning

### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment ( a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. The courses will be structured by chapter and available on freeCodeCamp and pluralsight. Courses will be available continuously nd exercises help you to improve your JavaScript coding skills, so new exercise sections will be added as the course progresses.

Happy Coding!
